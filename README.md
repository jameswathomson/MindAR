<H1>MindAR</H1>
<P>One of the selected units I taught on the HND in Computing was Augmented and Virtual Reality. I played around with various AR applications but ultimately there is a lot you can do for free using A-Frame etc.</P>
<P>I then found MindAR which has <strong>much</strong> better stability</P>
<P>There are some very small and unfinished projects hosted on this site, as a device camera needs to be used on a HTTPS website in order to function correctly</P>
